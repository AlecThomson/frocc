Notes
=====
- which python path? /opt/anaconda3/bin/python3?
- Units: all Hz and Jy/beam?
- casatasks logging filepath not working.
- first channel fails because "spw range is not valid". This doesn't make sense since I check for this during the setup scripts.
- channelNumbers are hardcoded to 3 digits, 001-999, this could be more generic. change the regex to grep
- np.nan become 0 in cube even if `dummy_data = np.ones(dummy_dims, dtype=np.float32) * np.nan`
- filename in header during cube creation. Which fieldname should I put in?
- revise sbatch header/settings
- make predictedOutputChannels shorter
- change chanbandwidth to chanwidth
- better use freq ranges
- add banchmark
